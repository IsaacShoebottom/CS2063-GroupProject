# Lantau

Lantau is an android file compressor, mainly to be used with social networks like Discord, which impose file limits.

## How to use

After installing, click the plus icon in the top right, you will then be prompted to select a file. Select any video file, and it will be compressed to a size under your selected size in the settings.

You can share the file by going to the completed tab and clicking the share icon (three connected dots). You will then be prompted to share the file with any app that can handle mp4 files.

## How it works

The app uses FFmpeg-Kit to compress the video, no cloud services, only your local device.

## Why the name?

The name comes from the founder of the FFmpeg project, Fabrice Bellard, who is used the pseudonym "Lantau" at the time.
